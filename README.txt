Mute Music in Battle, a mod for Total War: Warhammer 2

This is a one-line script that automatically mutes the game's music during a battle, so you can leave the volume settings on if you want still want music on the campaign map.

As @Vernon Roche points out in the comments, you don't need a mod to do this as long as you use the game's built-in Alt+M hotkey anytime you want to mute/unmute the music. This mod just automates it for battles so you don't need to use the hotkey every time.

It should be compatible with basically everything, including saved games.

I made this in response to a request submitted by The Duke through the [url=https://discord.gg/p5UNe6U]Modding Den's discord[/url]. They said they wanted it because "It's nice to be able to hear the sounds of the battle without [music] but the campaign map is eerily quiet without the music setting on."

If you later remove this mod and then want to load a saved game, no problem. Just make sure to check the "Enable all saves" checkbox at the bottom of the loading menu. (You might have to uncheck it and check it again. That checkbox is a bit clunky.)
